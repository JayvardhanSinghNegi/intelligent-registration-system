# Intelligent Registration System

## Assignment Overview

This project was created as part of a **placement assignment**.  
The task was to build a registration system, apply validations, and automate its testing using Selenium.

---

## Technologies Used

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Python
- Selenium WebDriver
- Google Chrome

---

## What I Built

I built a **registration form** that collects user details such as:
- First Name and Last Name
- Email and Phone Number
- Age and Gender
- Address
- Country, State, City
- Password and Confirm Password
- Terms & Conditions

The form is designed to be clean, properly aligned, and fully visible on a single screen.

---

## Validation Logic

The following validations are implemented:
- Mandatory fields must be filled
- Email format validation
- Phone number validation
- Password and confirm password must match
- Terms & Conditions must be accepted before submission

---

## Selenium Automation

The form is automated using **Python and Selenium**.

Two test cases are covered:
- **Negative case:** Submit form with missing required fields and capture validation errors
- **Positive case:** Submit form with valid inputs and verify successful submission

---

## Screenshots

Screenshots are captured automatically during automation execution and stored in: # Intelligent Registration System

## Screenshots

Screenshots are captured automatically during automation execution and stored in: automation/screenshots/

These screenshots show both error and success states of the form.
